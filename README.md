# BalatroMobileCompat
Patches some code to allow Balatro to work properly on mobile. Does nothing on PC.Now with more features(FPS cap, etc.).
Make custom UI toggles to config CRT patch and FPS cap.
This mod requires [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) in order to work.

Patches were taken from [balatro-mobile-builder](https://github.com/PGgamer2/balatro-mobile-builder), so check that for more information on what they do.
